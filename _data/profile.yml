  <p>
    Hi there. I'm Shuai Zhong (ÈçæÂ∏•, /d í ä≈ã1  Éua…™4/), you can also call me Chris. I'm a M.Phil. student @ <a href="https://mmlab.hk/" target="_blank">HKU MMLab</a>, 
    <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=The+University+of+Hong+Kong&t=&z=15&ie=UTF8&iwloc=&output=embed" target="_blank">The University of Hong Kong</a>. My research focuses on developing autonomous agents that can perceive, reason, and act in complex multimodal environments - 
    particularly in GUI control and collaborative multi-agent scenarios. ü§ñ
  </p>
  <p>
    My work spans from adversarial robustness in VLMs (exploring novel jailbreaking paradigms) to emergent behaviors in 
    multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. Currently, I'm exploring the intersection of 
    Vision-Language Foundation Models and Agentic AI Systems under the supervision of 
    <a href="https://luoping.me/" target="_blank">Dr. Ping Luo</a> and co-supervision of 
    <a href="https://ikekonglp.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Lingpeng Kong</a> @ <a href="https://www.cds.hku.hk/" target="_blank">HKU-CDS</a>. 
    I also had the privilege of working with <a href="https://xh-liu.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Xihui Liu</a> 
    as my UG FYP advisor @ <a href="https://www.eee.hku.hk/" target="_blank">HKU-EEE</a>.
  </p>

  Probably thinking about how to make AI agents more cooperative (while less likely to take over the world :P
