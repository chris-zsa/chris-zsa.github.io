  <p>
    Hi there. I'm a M.Phil. student at <a href="https://www.hku.hk/" target="_blank">The University of Hong Kong</a> 
    (where I also completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering). Currently, I'm exploring the intersection of 
    Vision-Language Foundation Models and Agentic AI Systems under the supervision of <a href="https://luoping.me/" target="_blank">Dr. Ping Luo</a> 
    and co-supervision of <a href="https://ikekonglp.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Lingpeng Kong</a>. 
    My research focuses on developing autonomous agents that can perceive, reason, and act in complex multimodal environments - 
    particularly in GUI control and collaborative multi-agent scenarios. ðŸ¤–
  </p>
  <p>
    My work spans from adversarial robustness in VLMs (exploring novel jailbreaking paradigms) to emergent behaviors in 
    multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. I'm particularly interested in staged workflows for interleaved RL, 
    where we decompose end-to-end VLM agents into specialized planner-actor architectures. Recent projects include 
    developing dense reward models for GUI automation and investigating the interpretability of vision-language reasoning chains.
  </p>

  Probably thinking about how to make AI agents more cooperative (while less likely to take over the world :P
